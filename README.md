# NewInterpreter
Sample python proof of concept for a new language

Currently the language ignores all whitespace. In order to print things out with spaces, the _ in a string or by itself will be replaced with a space when printing.
All lines are in the format command param1,param2,param3,..... and all commands are 3 characters long. See the builtIn dictionary for a list of commands and comments on how they work.
